# RAM-Monitor
Monitor system memory with an applet in menu bar.

Simple script for MacOS to see percentage RAM used. It simply checks available RAM every five seconds and displays in menu bar.

To run it, you may execute the python script or binary release. Keep in mind the binary release is not codesigned and you probably need to [override default security settings to launch it](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).
