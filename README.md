# RAM-Monitor
Monitor system memory with an applet in Mac's menu bar

This is a simple script I use on MacOS to see what percentage of the system's RAM is being used. It simply checks available RAM every five seconds and displays in menu bar.

To run it, you may execute the python script or binary release. Keep in mind the binary release is not codesigned and you probably need to [override default security settings to launch it](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).
